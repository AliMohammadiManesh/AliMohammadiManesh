# 👋 Hi, I’m Ali

I’m a **JavaScript and React developer** with a passion for **games, storytelling, and creative technology**.  
I’ve spent years building and publishing board games, running gaming cafés, and now I’m merging that world with programming turning imagination into interactive experiences.  

I love **video games**, especially **indie games** that focus on design, emotion, and creativity.  
Currently, I’m deep into **React**, **Next.js**, and **Python**, and always experimenting with how games and code can inspire each other.
